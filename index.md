# **Projects**

### MiniLLM
*Python, Pytorch, HuggingFace, tiktoken, Gradio*  | ([GitHub](https://github.com/aseemdandgaval/miniLLM)) | ([Website](Phttps://huggingface.co/spaces/AseemD/gpt2)) 
* Implemented GPT2-14M from scratch and trained on a cluster of 8 × 80GB A100 GPUs on 10 Billion tokens.
• Used strategies like Mixed Precision Training, Data Distributed Training, etc to optimize training (∼ 3.5 hours).
• Acheived a lower validation loss and matched the performance of the OpenAI checkpoint on the HellaSwag eval.
<br/>

### Image Dehazing
*Python, Pytorch*  | ([GitHub](https://github.com/AryanPhilip/ECE285-Project))
* Implemented a Pix2Pix GAN from scratch to perform image dehazing, improving visual clarity and detail in hazy images.
* Modified the original architecture to incorporate bilinear upsampling, resulting in improved PSNR and SSIM scores, and enhancing the quality and accuracy of dehazed images.
<br/>

### Food Calorie Estimator  
*Python, Pytorch, YOLOv5*  | ([GitHub](https://github.com/aseemdandgaval/Food-Calorie-Estimator))
* Implemented an object detection model (YOLOv5) for 20 different food items with 98.9% accuracy.
* Calculated calories of food items by finding it’s mass and volume occupied in bounding cuboid using the reference object in two optical views with food items having less than 10% error with respect to ground truth. 
<br/>

### Harry Potter Analysis 
*Python, SpaCy, NetworkX* | [GitHub](https://github.com/aseemdandgaval/Harry-Potter-Analysis))
* Parsed all Harry Potter books to extract interpersonal relationships of all characters using Named Entity Recognition.
* Created interactive network graphs, identified groups of characters using community detection, and tracked the importance of all characters over the entire series of books. (
<br/>

### Fraud Detection
*Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost* | ([GitHub](https://github.com/aseemdandgaval/fraud_detection))
* Cleaned, pre-processed and analyzed over 6 million rows of banking transactions.
*  Revealed the most important features that help detect fraudulent transactions and tested several ML models to get an F-1 score of 76.16 on a highly skewed dataset. 
<br/>

### GalleryGAN 
*Python, PyTorch* | ([GitHub](https://github.com/aseemdandgaval/GalleryGAN))
* Developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that generates images of Abstract Art from scratch.
* Final Images of art are generated from Gaussian noise and are of size 512x512 and 8 bit color. 
<br/>

### Exploratory Data Analysis on Industry Salaries
*Python, Pandas, MatplotLib, Seaborn* | ([GitHub](https://github.com/aseemdandgaval/EDA-Salaries))
* Performed an Exploratory Data Analysis on the salaries of working professionals in
the data industry in India (Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineesrs etc).
*  Cleaned and pre-processed a real world dataset using Pandas and NumPy.
*  Developed visual graphs based on sub-domains, years of experience, employers and inferred patterns such as
salary gap between locations, salary ranges as per experience and more. 
<br/>


### Pet Breed Classifier
Python, fast.ai | ([Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/aseemdandgaval/23-pet-breeds-image-classification))
*   Made a CNN classifier that classifies between 23 breeds of casts and dogs.
*   The result is a classifier model made by transfer learning with an accuracy of 85%.
*   The data set is made by me completely from scratch by web scraping and consists
of 3800 image.
