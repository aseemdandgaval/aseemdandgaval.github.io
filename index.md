# **Work Experience**

###   **CureSkin**  (YC in Healthcare) | * Data Science Intern (Computer Vision)* 
San Diego, USA | *Jun. 2024 - Sep. 2024*
* Implemented multiple deep learning architectures like FCN and PSPNet using PyTorch for semantic segmentation, aiding in the localization of skin conditions such as melasma.
* Fine-tuned state-of-the-art Vision Transformers, including SwinV2, BeiT, and DeiT, for enhanced performance in image classification tasks.
* Designed custom metrics to measure annotation consistency, automating the performance tracking of various annotators.
* Conducted statistical analysis to identify the optimal annotation strategy for small skin conditions such as acne and pimples.

###   **CureSkin**  (YC in Healthcare) | * Data Science Intern (Computer Vision)* 
Bengaluru, India | *Apr. 2022 - Jan. 2023*
* Iteratively visualized data through graphs, executed custom metric calculations, and conducted comprehensive tests across multiple datasets, informing crucial data-driven decisions and assessing project health.
* Experimented with state-of-the-art approaches from academic papers for Facial Image Inpainting and generation of 3D Face Meshes for head tracking.
* Designed and implemented custom RMSE and MAE metrics for spatial model architectures to benchmark performance
and determine the best fit for the data.
* Deployed models using Flask and optimized deployment, reducing time complexity by 50%.
* Automated image annotation/labeling and mask generation tasks using Python that streamlined model input pipelines.

# **Projects**

### GalleryGAN | Python, PyTorch | ([GitHub](https://github.com/aseemdandgaval/GalleryGAN))
* Developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that generates images of Abstract Art from scratch.
* Final Images of art are generated from Gaussian noise and are of size 512x512 and 8 bit color. 
<br/>

### Food Calorie Estimator | Python, Pytorch, YOLOv5  | ([GitHub](https://github.com/aseemdandgaval/Food-Calorie-Estimator))
* Implemented an object detection model (YOLOv5) for 20 different food items with 98.9% accuracy.
* Calculated calories of food items by finding it’s mass and volume occupied in bounding cuboid using the reference
object in two optical views with food items having less than 10% error with respect to ground truth. 
<br/>


### Harry Potter Analysis | Python, SpaCy, NetworkX | [GitHub](https://github.com/aseemdandgaval/Harry-Potter-Analysis))
* Parsed all Harry Potter books to extract interpersonal relationships of all characters using Named Entity Recognition.
* Created interactive network graphs, identified groups of characters using community detection, and tracked the importance of all characters over the entire series of books. (
<br/>


### Fraud Detection
* Cleaned, pre-processed and analyzed over 6 million rows of banking transactions.
*  Revealed the most important features that help detect fraudulent transactions and tested several ML models to get an F-1 score of 76.16 on a highly skewed dataset. ([GitHub](https://github.com/aseemdandgaval/fraud_detection))
<br/>

### Exploratory Data Analysis on Industry Salaries
* Performed an Exploratory Data Analysis on the salaries of working professionals in
the data industry in India (Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineesrs etc).
*  Cleaned and pre-processed a real world dataset using Pandas and NumPy.
*  Developed visual graphs based on sub-domains, years of experience, employers and inferred patterns such as
salary gap between locations, salary ranges as per experience and more. ([GitHub](https://github.com/aseemdandgaval/EDA-Salaries))
<br/>


### Pet Breed Classifier
*   Made a CNN classifier that classifies between 23 breeds of casts and dogs.
*   The result is a classifier model made by transfer learning with an accuracy of 85%.
*   The data set is made by me completely from scratch by web scraping and consists
of 3800 image. ([Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/aseemdandgaval/23-pet-breeds-image-classification))
