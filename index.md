I am a dedicated Computer Science engineering student currently in my third year. I am fascinated by Data Science, Machine and Deep Learning, these are my areas of interest and skill. I am always ready to learn and better myself with a positive and strong mindset



## Projects

### GALLERYGAN

* Made and trained a Generative Adverserial Network (GAN) that Generates images
of Abstract Art from scratch with PyTorch
* Trained on the Gallery AA data set that contains picture of abstract images.
The final result is images of abstract art after training for 500 Epochs. (GitHub)

#### Pet Breed Classifier

*   Made a CNN classifier that classifies between 23 breeds of casts and dogs.
*   The result is a classifier model made by transfer learning with an accuracy of 85%.
*   The data set is made by me completely from scratch by web scraping and consists
of 3800 image. (Dataset) (GitHub)

##### Exploratory Data Analysis on Industry Salaries

* Performed an Exploratory Data Analysis on the salaries of working professionals in
the data industry in India (Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineesrs etc).
2.  Cleaned and pre-processed a real world dataset using Pandas and NumPy.
3.  Plotted graphs and charts using Matplotlib/ Seaborn for easier visualization.
Asked and answered important questions about the data to gather insight and
make inferences. (GitHub).

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
