# **✦ About Me**

Hello! My name is Aseem Dandgaval and I'm an MS in Data Science grad at UC San Diego.
I’m passionate about developing products that leverage Machine Learning and Data Science to provide solutions for users. I am always ready to learn and better myself with a positive and strong mindset. If you're at this page, lets connect!

# **✦ Work Experience**

## **CureSkin** 
### **Computer Vision Intern** <div style="text-align: right"> Apr. 2022 - Jan. 2023 </div>
* Tested and applied various state-of-the-art approaches from academic papers on a real world dataset for Gener-
ative Facial Inpainting and Face Spatial Correspondence Projects.
* Designed and implemented custom RMSE and MAE metrics for spatial model architectures to benchmark
performance and determine the best fit for the data.
* Helped make important data driven decisions about the project’s direction through testing by visualization via
graphs and custom metric calculations over the entire dataset using Python scripts.
* Automated image annotation/labeling and mask generation tasks with OpenCV, PIL and Matplotlib.
* Deployed models using Flask in Linux servers and optimized deployment pipelines by reducing time complexity
by 50%

# **✦ Projects**

### GalleryGAN
* Developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that generates images of Abstract Art from scratch.
* Final Images of art are generated from Gaussian noise and are of size 512x512 and 8 bit color. ([GitHub](https://github.com/aseemdandgaval/GalleryGAN))
<br/><br/>


### Food Calorie Estimator 
* Implemented an object detection model (YOLOv5) for 20 different food items with 98.9% accuracy.
* Calculated calories of food items by finding it’s mass and volume occupied in bounding cuboid using the reference
object in two optical views with food items having less than 10% error with respect to ground truth. [GitHub]((https://github.com/aseemdandgaval/Food-Calorie-Estimator))
<br/><br/>


### Harry Potter Analysis 
* Extracted and filtered relationships of all characters from Harry Potter books using NER.
* Created network graphs, identified groups of characters using community detection, and tracked the importance
of all characters over the entire series of books. [GitHub]((https://github.com/aseemdandgaval/Harry-Potter-Analysis))
<br/><br/>


### Exploratory Data Analysis on Industry Salaries
* Performed an Exploratory Data Analysis on the salaries of working professionals in
the data industry in India (Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineesrs etc).
*  Cleaned and pre-processed a real world dataset using Pandas and NumPy.
*  Developed visual graphs based on sub-domains, years of experience, employers and inferred patterns such as
salary gap between locations, salary ranges as per experience and more. ([GitHub](https://github.com/aseemdandgaval/EDA-Salaries))
<br/><br/>


### Pet Breed Classifier
*   Made a CNN classifier that classifies between 23 breeds of casts and dogs.
*   The result is a classifier model made by transfer learning with an accuracy of 85%.
*   The data set is made by me completely from scratch by web scraping and consists
of 3800 image. ([Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/aseemdandgaval/23-pet-breeds-image-classification))
