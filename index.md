# **About Me**

I am a dedicated Computer Science engineering student currently in my third year. I am fascinated by Data Science, Machine and Deep Learning, these are my areas of interest and skill. I am always ready to learn and better myself with a positive and strong mindset

# **Work Experience**

### CureSkin | Computer Vision Intern

* Tested and applied various state-of-the-art approaches from academic papers on a real world dataset for Gener-
ative Facial Inpainting and Face Spatial Correspondence Projects.
* Designed and implemented custom RMSE and MAE metrics for spatial model architectures to benchmark
performance and determine the best fit for the data.
* Helped make important data driven decisions about the projectâ€™s direction through testing by visualization via
graphs and custom metric calculations over the entire dataset using Python scripts.
* Automated image annotation/labeling and mask generation tasks with OpenCV, PIL and Matplotlib.
* Deployed models using Flask in Linux servers and optimized deployment pipelines by reducing time complexity
by 50%


# **Projects**

### GalleryGAN

* Made and trained a Generative Adverserial Network (GAN) that Generates images
of Abstract Art from scratch with PyTorch
* Trained on the Gallery AA data set that contains picture of abstract images.
The final result is images of abstract art after training for 500 Epochs. ([GitHub](https://github.com/aseemdandgaval/GalleryGAN))

### Pet Breed Classifier

*   Made a CNN classifier that classifies between 23 breeds of casts and dogs.
*   The result is a classifier model made by transfer learning with an accuracy of 85%.
*   The data set is made by me completely from scratch by web scraping and consists
of 3800 image. ([Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/aseemdandgaval/23-pet-breeds-image-classification))

### Exploratory Data Analysis on Industry Salaries

* Performed an Exploratory Data Analysis on the salaries of working professionals in
the data industry in India (Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineesrs etc).
*  Cleaned and pre-processed a real world dataset using Pandas and NumPy.
*  Plotted graphs and charts using Matplotlib/ Seaborn for easier visualization.
Asked and answered important questions about the data to gather insight and
make inferences. ([GitHub](https://github.com/aseemdandgaval/EDA-Salaries))
